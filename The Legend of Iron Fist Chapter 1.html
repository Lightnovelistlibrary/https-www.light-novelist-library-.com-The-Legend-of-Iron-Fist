      <h1 style="text-align:center;">Chapter 1: The Fall of Jade Village</h1>
          <p>
            The air was thick with the scent of burning wood and the cries of the dying. Liu Feng stood amidst the ruins of Jade Village, his home, now nothing more than a smoldering wasteland. His hands trembled with a mixture of fear and anger as he looked upon the bodies of those he had once known and loved.

But there was no time to grieve. The invaders were still out there, their war cries echoing through the valley as they hunted down the last of the villagers. Liu Feng knew he had to act, but he was just one man, untrained and unarmed. What could he do against such overwhelming odds?

As he knelt beside his fallen parents, tears streaming down his face, a shadow fell over him. Liu Feng looked up to see an old man, his face lined with age, yet his eyes sharp and filled with a fierce energy.

"Stand up, boy," the old man said, his voice firm. "The time for tears is over. If you wish to avenge your village, to protect those who remain, you must become something more."

Liu Feng wiped his tears and rose to his feet. "Who are you?"

The old man smiled. "I am no one important. But I can make you into someone who is. If you have the will, I can teach you the way of the Iron Fist."

And so, Liu Feng’s journey began—not just to defeat the warlords, but to become the legend his people needed. The path would be long and dangerous, but Liu Feng had already lost everything. There was nothing left to fear.
